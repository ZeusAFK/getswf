Thanks for download Simple Web Framework (SWF)

This project is mainly aimed at developing simple web pages that do not necessarily require a web programming language and database. Typically for this type of project is chosen some CMS, but this implies that the web may be vulnerable because for the most known CMS every day are discovered new vulnerabilities, also add us requirements to the project (a language of web programming, database). Another option is to make the product HTML, CSS and pure JS and is the option you choose this project, but do this for every page you have to do it becomes quite tedious and even more to repeat the same for different projects we have to do.

Simple web framework provides the necessary functionality for a single page in HTML, CSS and JS where only pure data must be specified for the site in a file data.json and develop modules that need for each page in our project. The development of a module can be as simple as creating a folder for the same template.html containing a file with the content to display.
